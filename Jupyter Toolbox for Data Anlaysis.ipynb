    "# Replacing Excel with Jupyter Notebooks\n",

    "Anything you don't is scary and for many people that's doubly true for code. Moving from Excel to Python has a huge number of benefits, your work becomes:\n",
    "- repeatable: It's code you can easily re-run and use the same pieces of work in a different situation\n",
    "- understandable: If you perform a piece of analysis in code, the code will show you what has been done. While not perfect, this is still better than Excel, where all you see is the end product\n",
    "- scaleable: Excel struggles with large amounts of data. Python doesn't. Eventually you'll hit a limit but it's far further off.\n",
    "- more powerful: Things that are trivial in Python can be exceptionally hard in Excel (for example using text fields in the value part of a pivot chart)\n",
    "- Harder to screw up your data - If you fuck up in Excel NBED\n",
    "\n",
    "But unlike Excel, it doesn't have lots of nice shiny buttons. The goal of this workbook is to show you how to do all the common actions you take in Excel in python as well as how to work with data. \n",

    "- You run the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking the code into cells it allows you to work in steps and investigate the data as you are going.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has two modes\n",
    "- Command mode (let's you create new cells, delete them, run them etc.)\n",
    "- Edit mode (let's you type into and edit the cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape takes you to command mode (the highlighted cell will have a blue bar on the left),  Enter takes you to edit mode (the highlighted cell will have a green bar on the left).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are buttons at the top, I'd highly recommend learning the shortcuts. Aside from those two the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Mode:**\n",
    "- a: create a cell above\n",
    "- b: create a cell below\n",
    "- Cmd/Ctrl+Enter - Runs a cell\n",
    "- dd: deletes a cell (be careful, you can't undo this)\n",
    "- m: Set a cell to text mode (markdown), like this cell you're reading\n",
    "- y: Set a cell to code mode (the default)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit mode:**\n",
